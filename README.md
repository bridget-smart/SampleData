# SampleData
Sample data for code testing


Sample net information flows. This dataset is a sample of the net information flows between 150 handles. The net flow is a random number drawn from an exponential distribution. The net flow for each year is a random number drawn from an exponential distribution. The net flow for each year is normalised by the maximum net flow for that year.
